# crypto-market-prediction
A project which helps to predict bitcoin prediction analysis for future.
•	The volatility in the crypto market makes it very difficult to predict a good time for investment for regular traders. There are a lot of factors that play into the role of disrupting the crypto market. 
•	For example, tweet-storms from influential people like top billionaires play a major role in creating ripples in the market. But we are still not leveraging these signals in a quantitative manner to our benefit. 
•	Also at the same time, there are various factors which include seasonal trends, few outliers etc., which play a major role in defining the market trend. So, for a trader to predict what a good time is to invest is really an arduous task. 
•	Hence, in this project we are trying to figure out “how” these trends play a vital role, and we will predict whether it’s an optimal time to invest considering all these scenarios for a specific cryptocurrency.
